            Apple was founded by <i><b><u>Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak,</b></i></u> and <i><b><u>Ronald Wayne</i></b></u> in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though <em>Wayne sold his share back within 12 days</em>.

             It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line.Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, while Jobs and others resigned to found NeXT.

            <p>I would like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the victims of the COVID-19 and my heartfelt sympathy to all those who have been affected by the spread of COVID-19. I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the many people, including medical professionals, who are working hard to prevent the spread of infection.</p>
            <p>We at the Yamaha Group share our corporate philosophy “Sharing Passion & Performance,” and contribute to the enriched lifestyles of people while focusing our business on sound and music. With our brand promise “Make Waves” we capture that special moment when our customers’ hearts tremble. This brand promise is our pledge to our customers that we are committed to further promoting manufacturing that values the customers’ perspective, an approach we inherited and have followed since our foundation in 1887. In this way we provide products and services that resonate with customers.</p>
            <p>Yamaha has established its management vision and is steadily evolving toward “Becoming an Indispensable, Brilliantly Individual Company” that can “Boost brand power to become a highly profitable enterprise” as its future image in the medium to long term. We outlined our basic strategy to “develop closer ties with customers and society, and boost value creation capabilities” in our medium-term management plan “Make Waves 1.0” that encompasses the three-year period from April 2019.</p>
            <p>People’s lives have become more convenient as digital technologies accelerate and AI and IoT technologies progress, and along with increased material wealth, people are seeking greater spiritual satisfaction and authenticity in the present era. In corporate management the requirements for contributing to a sustainable society are further heightened and a broad awareness of the links between social contribution and corporate value creation are spreading.</p>
            <p>In addition, people's lifestyles and values have changed dramatically in the face of many challenges caused by the effect of COVID-19. We consider our strength in combining technology and sensibility as a means to generate opportunities for Yamaha to make a change and stay ahead of the times. We will continue to create new value and to propose lifetime value for each customer by developing closer ties with our customers.</p>
            <p>We at Yamaha Group want to be a company that supports the challenges and passion of each and every one of our customers. We will continue to make every effort to be a company that can meet everyone’s expectations. We look forward to you being able to stay with us, and greatly appreciate your ongoing support.</p>
